# GitHub Copilot Commit Message Instructions

This file guides GitHub Copilot (and other AI tools) to generate commit messages that comply with our commitlint configuration.

## Commit Message Format

Use **Conventional Commits** format with RELAXED rules:

```
type(scope?): subject

body?

footer?
```

## Valid Types

Use one of these types (REQUIRED):

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only
- **style**: Code style (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring (neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature)
- **perf**: Performance improvement
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, config, etc.)
- **ci**: CI/CD changes
- **build**: Build system or external dependencies
- **revert**: Revert a previous commit

## Subject Line Rules (RELAXED FOR COPILOT)

GitHub Copilot currently does NOT honor commitlint files, so we use RELAXED rules:

✅ **ALLOWED** (Relaxed Rules):

- **Any case is acceptable**: lowercase, sentence-case, start-case
- **Period at end**: Warning only (discouraged but not blocking)
- **Length**: Up to 120 characters (warning after 100)

Examples of ACCEPTABLE commits:

```
feat: add user authentication          (lowercase - recommended)
feat: Add user authentication          (sentence-case - allowed)
fix: Resolve database timeout          (sentence-case - allowed)
docs: Update API documentation         (sentence-case - allowed)
feat: add feature.                     (period at end - warning)
```

❌ **NOT ALLOWED** (Strict Enforcement):

```
Add new feature                        (missing type - BLOCKED)
Feat: add feature                      (uppercase type - BLOCKED)
feat:                                  (empty subject - BLOCKED)
```

## Optional Scope

Scope is optional but useful for monorepos:

```
feat(auth): add JWT middleware
fix(database): resolve connection pooling
docs(readme): update installation steps
```

## Body and Footer (Optional)

Extended commit message format:

```
feat(api): add user profile endpoint

Add GET /api/users/:id endpoint with authentication.
Includes validation and error handling.

Closes #123
```

## AI-Specific Tips

1. **Type is REQUIRED** - Always start with a valid type from the list above
2. **Type must be lowercase** - Use `feat:` not `Feat:`
3. **Subject case is flexible** - Both "add feature" and "Add feature" work
4. **Keep it concise** - Try to stay under 100 characters for the header
5. **Period at end is discouraged** - But won't block the commit
6. **Use scope for context** - Especially helpful in monorepos

## Examples

### Good Commits (Will Pass)

```
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve database connection timeout
docs: update installation guide
feat(auth): add JWT token validation
fix(api): handle null response from database
chore: update dependencies
test: add unit tests for user service
```

### Bad Commits (Will Fail)

```
Add user authentication              (missing type)
FEAT: add authentication             (uppercase type)
feat:                                (empty subject)
new feature for users                (missing type)
```

## Summary

- **Type**: REQUIRED (lowercase, from valid list)
- **Subject**: Required, any case, try to stay under 100 chars, avoid period at end
- **Scope**: Optional but recommended
- **Body/Footer**: Optional

This configuration ensures commits are both human-readable and machine-parseable for changelog generation while accommodating GitHub Copilot's natural commit message style.
