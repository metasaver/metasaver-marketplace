/build, ok execute the epic docs/epics/backlog/msc-ops-operations-system. remember to always use metasaver plugin agents, skills, templates and follow the workflow using agents in paralelel. If you make changes to multi-mono, you can use the build and publish command in that repo to publish to verdaccio, then you can do a clean and build here to pick up those changes. If you make changes to multi-mono, you have to use a git worktree, and you should make sure that gets added to all docs as needed if that is used. You dont need to do a worktree in this repo, just multi-mono because it is shared. Never check anythign into git commit or push, but you can use worktrees. We already have an approved epic, you can proceed to the execution phase
